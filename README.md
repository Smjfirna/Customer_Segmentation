# Customer Segmentation

## Project Description
In this project, customer grouping will be carried out based on 4 categories, namely A, B, C and D using the Customer Segmentation technique. with this technique the company's product sales products can be marketed more effectively based on the right customer category. 

This process is done by applying various Machine Learning algorithms to get a more accurate customer classification based on certain criteria.

## Dataset
The dataset used is taken from Kaggle.com, namely [Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer) from AV - Janatahack which is divided into train data with Features and “Segmentation” and test data without and without “Segmentation”.

- ID : Unique ID
- Gender : Gender of the customer.
- Ever_mariage : Marital status of the customer.
- Age : Age of the customer.
- Graduate : Is the customer a graduate ?
- Profession : Profession of the customer.
- Work Experience : Work Experience in years.
- Spending score : Spending score of the customer.
- Familiy_size : Number of family members for the customer (including the customer).
- Var_1 : Anonymised Category for the customer.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Business understanding**:
    - Understand business needs and consider the appropriate technology stages to solve business problems. 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Understand the types of data and consider the stages of data cleaning and processing using visualization and histograms, box plots.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing data using mean and mode techniques
    - Handle irrelevant data (outliers) in data
    - replace and remove irrelevant data
    - coded categorical data using label_ecoder and one heat coding.

4. **Model Building**:
    - Train the data and compare relevant models to train data to find the best model with the highest accuracy.

6. **Model Evaluation and Discussion**:
    - Evaluate the trained model with the dataset with accuracy and classification reports.
    - Predict test data to determine customer segmentation using the best accuracy trained model.

## Tools and Library
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and Gradient Boosting for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Collaboratory To document the analysis, model development, and results.
